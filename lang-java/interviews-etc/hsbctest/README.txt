Enclosed are my answers to the driverless car problem.

A Junit test and a Cucumber test (against AC) are provided.

Whilst in reality, I might be tempted for a simler approach based on expected
lifetime of the code and timescales to write the solution, I hope this solution
provides enough insight into my thought process.

Best wishes
